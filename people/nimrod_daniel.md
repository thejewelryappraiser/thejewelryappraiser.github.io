Nimrod Daniel is working on the algorithm of the olfactory-based navigation in turbulent plumes. This work is a part of the
BSF-funded research project of Prof. Ally Harari (Volcani Center), Prof. Roi Gurka (CCU) and our laboratory. Some new results
will be published soon. Meanwhile it's a top secret work :)
