Sabrina started working on a joint research project of our lab with the laboratory of Dr. Amir Paster and Prof. Mario Sofer from the School of Medicine and Ichelov Hospital. The research relates to an improvement of
flow for irrigating kidney stone pieces during the surgery. The work is a combination
of experimental and numerical study.

Since summer 2017, Sabrina has joined the M.Sc. research project, again with particles and turbulence, but now in 
a completely different range of Reynolds numbers - a high speed air flow with particles and droplets.
