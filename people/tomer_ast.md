Tomer Ast is working on the multi-scale PIV - PTV data analysis from our recent measurement session at the Environmental Wind Tunnel at the Israeli Institute of Biological research. He develops his own PIV code and will work on estimating correlations between the large scale and small scale statistics of turbulent flow above a canopy boundary layer.
