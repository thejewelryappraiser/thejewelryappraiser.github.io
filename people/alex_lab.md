Alex has joined the Department of Fluid Mechanics and Heat transfer in 2006, right after his postdoctoral research period at the Institute of Hydrodynamics at ETH Zurich and after Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the Technion, Haifa at 2003.


The research interests are related to experimental fluid dynamics, with the special focus on
turbulent flows. More specifically, the major goal is to understand the subtle changes of turbulence structure in the flows with external influences or additives, e.g. stratification, two-phase particle-laden flows, dilute polymers, etc. In addition, Alex is promoting the open source software and open science. Additional research topics outside of small scale turbulence are in the fields of complex (pulsating, unsteady) flows in biology and medicine.
