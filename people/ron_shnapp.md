Ron Shnapp started as a research assistant working on the <strong>resuspension of particles from smooth and rough walls</strong> under an oscillating grid generated turbulent flow, together with [Yosef Meller](yosef_meller.html). He continued as a Master student (M.Sc.) on a direct path and recently started his direct Ph.D. program. The thesis is on particles in turbulent flows with pressure/acceleration changes.
