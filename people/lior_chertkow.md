Lior Chertkow ([LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lior-chertkow-b77534b5)) performs M.Sc. research in our laboratory, working in collaboration with the group of Prof. Avi Seifert and uses his microfluidic laboratory and the micro-PIV system. The research topic is the electro-rheological fluids in microchannels. 

A nice example of a velocity flow profile in a micro-channel is visible with the ERF particle chains

The experimental setup is a microPIV system, based on an inverted microscope, laser and a 
digital camera, visualizing a flow and motion of ERF particles.
