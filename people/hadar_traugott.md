Hadar is back with our lab, after a couple of years of research in the Dead Sea Corporations. She is at the beginning of her **Ph.D.** on the _bio-refinery and macro-algae growth in the open sea project_, co-supervised with [Dr. Alex Golberg](http://www.tau.ac.il/~agolberg/) from the Porter School of Environmental Engineering  Hadar is a proud awardee of the Boris Mints Institute scholarship.

Hadar Traugott **M.Sc. thesis** was the resuspension of solid particles in turbulent environment. Turbulent flow picks up the solid particles lying on the bottom with and without mean flow (or mean shear). This aspect was not known as good as the resuspension in fixed or moving beds of flowing channels. The question whether different mechanisms of resuspension are observable experimentally.


<!-- ### CV
