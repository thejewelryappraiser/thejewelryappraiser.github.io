Congratulations to Shaily who successfully finished her M.Sc. thesis on the fluid-structure interaction model of an aortic valve. Shaily modeled the flow and the contact of the valve for several cases from healthy to stenosis and with transplant valves (TAVI) in two configurations. The results and the conclusions are clear and very prominent. We hope to see her journal publication being reviewed and published soon.
