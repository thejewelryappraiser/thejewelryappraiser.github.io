Our lab is a proud member of the Metro450 consortium, <http://www.metro450.org.il/> - a wafer 
metrology consortium under MAGNET of the Chief Scientist Office. We participate in the Work Package
number 3, <http://www.metro450.org.il/Metro450/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=84&FID=1122> 
working on the prevention of wafer contamination using flows. Our partner is the Applied Materials (Israel)
with whom we try to solve the problems in the LoadLock unit that is responsible for the 
transfer of the wafer from atmospheric to vacuum pressure and back. In addition, we develop a 
three-dimensional mobile imaging system for the flow analysis in-situ for other partners, such as
Jordan Valley and Intel. 

See more details on this project in the near future. Recently we presented a poster on the 3rd annual 
Metro450 conference.
