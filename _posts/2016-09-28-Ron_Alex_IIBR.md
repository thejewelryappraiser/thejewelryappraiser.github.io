title: Ron and Alex at IIBR
---

We are very glad to come back from our first ever "field" experiment with the
3D-PTV system. Ron and Alex, with great help of Yosef and the team of the IIBR
have managed to safely transfer (both ways), install and measure in the (likely) the
largest wind tunnel in Israel at the Institute for Biological Research. The real-time
image processing system allows us to downscale the 3D-PTV recording bandwidth
so significantly that we can pack the system in 3-4 boxes and arrive at your place.
We could also measure at the speed of 1 m/s in the rough boundary layer. More details
to follow. No images were released for the public yet.
