title: Important Reasons That Jewelry Appraisals Matter

---
## **How important is it to have your jewelry appraised?**

**It is crucial to have a valid appraisal for your valuable jewelry.**

If you are going to insure your jewelry you must have one. Also, because the price of gold, diamonds and gems changes over time it is important to have an appraisal tied to a specific point in time so there is an accurate reference of the value of the piece. If the item is lost, damaged or stolen there must be a frame of reference to determine the dollar amount of the loss. Knowing how much your items are worth will help prevent you from under-insuring or over-insuring your pieces. Also, you cannot trust the seller of the jewelry to appraise the pieces. Insurance companies will only value an appraisal from an authority that is impartial, such as a certified jewelry appraiser. From divorces to estate taxes, donations and loans there are many reasons to have your [jewelry professionally appraised](https://goo.gl/maps/qeLtLTLqRmT2).
