## M.Sc. or Ph.D. in an analytical and experimental study of Electro-Rheological Fluids 

Electrorheological fluids are suspensions of small non-conducting but electrically active particles in an electrically insulating fluid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrorheological_fluid

The study is devoted to ERF in microchannels, bridging the analytical modeling of particle-particle interactions and the experiments 
performed using micro particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) in a channel with DC or AC electrical fields.
