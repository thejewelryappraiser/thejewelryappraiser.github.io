When you work with Debòrah, you can expect more then just the discretion and value of a certain piece of jewelry. Her method of appraising is far more in depth when compared to industry standards and you will quickly recognize her passion in making your appraisal nothing but the very best.

Debòrah’s credentials include a Master Graduate Jeweler degree, which affords her the wisdom to know precisely what goes into making a particular piece of jewelry. She is quite capable of

evaluating the jewelry’s workmanship, making sure that your jewelry piece has been properly crafted and is suitable to wear. Feeling good and confident about your appraisal is Debòrah’s primary concern.

An appraisal done by someone without the proper training will very often misinform their client, thus affecting many situations, such as; a return policy, a limited warrantee, the value of an heirloom, insurance, etc.

Most insurance companies will not cover the workmanship that goes into making a piece of jewelry. The qualified appraiser’s ability to know precisely whether a particular piece is or isn’t made correctly can mean the difference between feeling 100% secure and 100% sorry. Without a proper evaluation, a consumer may never be able to recover a substantial loss.
