title: PIV and IR imaging combined
---


We investigate the flow field in a turbulent boundary layer in a flume, by using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Hot-Foil Infrared Imaging (HFIRI) techniques. Coherent patterns in the flow were identified and characterized by using instantaneous velocity and temperature fields. The velocity fields in the streamwise - spanwise plane were measured in parallel to the temperature distribution of the flume bottom. The identified patterns are represented by means of their spatial characteristics ñ a non-dimensional spatial separation between streamwise patterns, $$\lambda^+$$.
