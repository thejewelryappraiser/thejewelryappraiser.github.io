title: Bats, why bats?
---

Thanks to the group of Prof. Yossi Yovel from Tel Aviv University, we got exposed
to some problems related to bats echolocation. Our unique imaging capabilities allow
us to extract more insight from bat's behaviour during echo-location events. We tried
to capture its nostrel positions during sound emission, beam forming activity, we
tried to measure noise due to turbulent flow around ears and locate sound waves using
our new Background Oriented Schlieren method.
