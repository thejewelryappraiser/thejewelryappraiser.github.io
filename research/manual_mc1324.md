[Manual](files/Manual_MC1324.doc)



### Software

[Sobel 2DPTV][3] is the 3D-PTV software adapted to use the RAW files, generated by this camera.


### Applications



*   Frequency Calculator

1.  Calculating the clocks and commands values necessary to set the desired FPS.

*   Pure GEV Example

1.  Watching the various modes ("Target","Sobel" etc.) real-time.
2.  Adjusting camera parameters. (G/L , Thresholds, BlackLevel, Gain, etc.)

*   Coyote

1.  Adjusting camera parameters.
2.  Adjusting saving settings (output format, file(s) destination, etc.)
3.  Acquisition.



### Pros



1.  Watching "Target mode" real-time.
2.  Higher fps than before.
3.  Shorter ping with the camera (better communication responsiveness).



### Cons



1.  Multiplicity of applications.
2.  Complication of modifying camera parameters.



*   Step 1: **Physical Preparation**

    *   Place the camera.
    *   Connect the blue communication cable to the PT1000 Ethernet card.
    *   Connect the black power cable between the back of the camera and the AC inlet.
    *   Make sure the green light at the back of the camera is on.
    *   Make sure there's a LAN communication between the camera and the computer.
    *   Remove lens cover.


*   Step 2: **Setting FPS using Frequency Calculator application**

*   Open "Frequency Calculator" application for desired fps.
    :   *   Width: 1280
        *   Height: 1024
        *   Check "No Sobel" box
        *   Press "APPLY"
        *   Choose the desired FPS by moving the slide bar at the bottom.



*   Step 3: **Initial image acquisition**

    *   Open Pure GEV Example application. (Don't close the Frequency Calculator application)
    *   Click "Connect" to open connection window.
        *   Double-Click the "IP Engine; MAC " line. The connection window will close. A connection with the camera was established.
        *   Open configuration menu by pressing "Configuration"
    *   Under "Clock Settings" section (Scroll all the way down) place the values from "Frequency Calculator" under "Clock" (Sensor clock, Pixel clock)

Note: Left-click the mouse somewhere outside the value field in order to apply your request.


:   *   Close the "Configuration" window by clicking the "X" on the upper-right corner.
    *   Press "Start acquisition" button.
    *   Make sure the "frame rate" value on the bottom-right corner displays your selected FPS.

*Note*: In case of a black image make sure you removed the lens-cover, then open lens' shutter, and finally point a moderate light source toward the camera.


*   Re-open the "Configuration" window.
*   Scroll down to "AnalogControls" Section and adjust parameters:
*   GainRaw (48 128) Lower value = brighter image.
*   BlackLevelRaw (0 255) Higher value = higher contrast and darkness. Recommended values are 210 ± 40
*   FPN (1 255) recommended values are 100 ± 20.
*   Close the "Configuration" window.
*   Re-Place the camera exactly on the object.
*   Re-Focus the camera on the object.
*   Re-Adjust the lighting in the room and the surroundings.
*   Stop the acquisition by pressing "Stop acquisition" button on the GUI.

*   Switch into Sobel mode by selecting "Gray8" mode.
*   Start acquisition again.
*   Re-Adjust shutters, lighting, and other camera parameters.
*   Stop acquisition.

*   Switch into Target mode by selecting "Target" mode.
*   Modify Sobel threshold into "1000".
*   Start acquisition. The image is live Target-mode.
*   Optimize the image by moving the slide-bars of "Sobel Threshold" and "Gray Threshold".

*Note*: The application crashes when there're more targets than the maximum number of targets allowed. The default value of maximum targets is 512. How to change the value will be discussed later.


*   Open the "Configuration" window.
*   Browse all the way down to the last line "SaveAsPowerUpProfile".
*   Press the "{Command}" button.
*   Close the "Configuration" window.
*   Stop acquisition.
*   Press "Disconnect" button.

Note: It's impossible to be connected to the camera through more than one application at a given moment.



#####  Step 4: Recording scenes using Coyote

*   Start Coyote application.
*   Detect the camera by clicking "Detect" button under "Connection" tab.
*   Double-Click the "IP Engine; MAC " line. The connection window will close.
*   Select the camera type by pressing "Select" button under "Connection" tab.
*   Select "Standard CameraLink Camera" under "Pleora Technologies Inc".
*   Press "Connect" to establish a connection with the camera.
*   Make sure "Connected to device " is indicated at "Status" line.
*   Choose "Image Saving" tab.
*   Select "Raw data files"
*   Choose saving destination by pressing " " button next to the path.
*   Open the configuration window by pressing "Configure " button.
*   Select the "Image" tab.
*   Modify the width into "20".
*   The maximum number of targets is set by "Height" parameter.
*   Press "Apply" button.

*Note*: Higher "Height" value results with larger RAW files' size.


*   Choose the "Port Communication" tab.

*   In the "Command" line type the command starting with ":" "md00000001" (":md00000001") then press "Send" button.
*   Press "OK" button to apply and close the configuration window.

*Note*: Now you've set the camera working at Target mode and saving small RAW files. It's impossible to see a normal image. The only clear image possible to track is a targets view through "Pure GEV Example" application. In order to cancel this mode, type the following command in the "Port Communication" tab, ":md00000000".


*   Select "Acquisition" tab.
*   Start acquisition by pressing "Start".
*   To start recording, go to "Image Saving" tab and click the "Start" button. Click "Stop" to stop recording.

*Note*: After finishing recording the session, verify no skipped frames: Count the successful frames recorder in the folder (CTRL+A). Compare that number to the total frames actually taken (subtract the serial numbers of last and first frames and add 1).
