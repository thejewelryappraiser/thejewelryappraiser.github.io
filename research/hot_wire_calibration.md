title: Look-up-table (LUT) based multi-hot-wire calibration
---

This was a M.Sc. project of Efi Ezri.

From Wikipedia:
> "An **anemometer** is a device for measuring the
velocity or the pressure of the wind, and is one instrument used in a
weather station. The term is derived from the Greek word, anemos,
meaning wind." Read more about hot-wire anemometers on eFunda web site.

LUT:
> LUT is a shortcut of the lookup-table (In computer science, a lookup
table is a data structure, usually an array or associative array, used
to replace a runtime computation with a simpler lookup operation. The
speed gain can be significant, since retrieving a value from memory is
often faster than undergoing an expensive computation. Wikipedia)

### Details

The algorithm and the software package are developed jointly by a group
of students and researchers at the Faculty of Engineering, Tel Aviv
University [http://www.eng.tau.ac.il][]


-   it’s an open source under BSD license
-   it’s written currently in Matlab (works fine under Windows XP,
    Matlab R2006x)
-   it makes use of the following open-source Matlab packages from the
    Matlab Central:
    -   kdtree by Steven Michael, MIT
    -   kNearestNeighbors by Ani
    -   inpaint\_nans by John D’Errico

-   it’s developed using a generous help of Lavoie P. from Queen’s
    University, Canada, providing us with his Labview subroutines (not
    actually used, but very helpful). Read, e.g. his publication: PDF or
    look at Scholar
-   Ideas are taken mostly from the literature (easiest way is to google
    for “multi hot wire calibration”, e.g. \>\>\>
    -   Lavoie P. et al, Exp. Fluids, etc.
    -   van Daijk et al. Exp. Fluids, 2004
