Working with Deborah and Louis was a wonderful experience. This is the second time I am using their appraisal services. Deborah is the consummate appraisal professional (incredible amount of knowledge of gemstones and the industry) and you know from the moment you walk into their office, they love what they do and understand how important it is to get it right. She had all the equipment needed to do the examination right there in front of me. She took the time and went over every detail of my coveted pieces of jewelry and spoke to me straight. From the start, you know Deborah is a fierce consumer advocate. Going above and beyond, she offered her services (unsolicited) with a ring that needed to go back to the seller for replacement and to help me negotiate with the seller directly. I really appreciated that. Deborah is a rare, rare gem!!

Deborah made the experience easy as it could be. She definitely know everything there is to know about jewelry and had an answer for everything i threw at her. Was a pleasure working with her and its safe to say that I will never be using a different Appraiser!

Hands down I am the happiest person having gone to The Jewelry Appraiser! Debòrah was up front and honest, and extremely informative at our appointment. Being first timers to the world of appraisals and jewelry insurance, she made sure to take the time to explain the process to us, and made us feel super comfortable. She truly loves what she does, and the whole appt was actually fun! She was very quick to deliver our appraisal to us and gave us all the need information to easily obtain jewelry insurance as well as what to be weary of. She makes sure that you are taken care of, and truly wants to be there every step of the way. So thankful to have met Debòrah & Louis, they run a fantastic company!

Deborah is amazing!! I had brought the GIA report for my engagement ring with me, but she did not look at it until the very end when her appraisal was complete. She was able to match every single detail that was on the GIA report, and then gave even more detail beyond that report. She is truly talented and amazing, and offered great advice for insuring and protecting my ring. She took the time to answer any questions, and i felt that she really took the time to get to know me on a personal level as well. I would recommend Deborah for any and all of your jewelry appraisal needs- what a great experience!

Deborah was incredible, super friendly and efficient. She told us about her history where the ring came from, who created it and how it was meant to find me! I highly recommend her.

My father-in-law was very generous to my mother-in-law, and over the 57 years of their marriage presented her with a few pieces of expensive jewelry. When both parents were both gone, my husband had the responsibility of assessing the value of this jewelry and liquidating the pieces. We had no experience and had no idea what to do. That's when my husband found Deborah, the Jewelry Appraiser, and her able assistant and partner, Louis. Deborah delicately cleaned each piece, and inspected it under a microscope. She was able to tell a little bit about the approximate age and history of each. This was followed by a more extensive and thorough written report and appraisal, which helped in liquidating the estate.

After the estate matters were finished, we went back to Deborah for help in evaluating and selling a piece of jewelry that had been in my family for many years. On both occasions Deborah was supportive and encouraging. To her, jewelry is a passion and an art. She navigated us through a stressful process, and for that we are very thankful. We recommend Deborah without hesitation
