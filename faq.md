### **What do you charge for an appraisal?**

Fees are charged by the hour.

### **How often do I need my jewelry appraised?**

Most insurance companies recommend updating every two (2)- three (3) years.

### **Are you a “Certified” Appraiser?**

Yes! Debòrah Ann Villepigue is a Certified Senior Member of the National Association of Jewelry Appraisers. A Certified Senior Member is designated when an appraiser has completed all the necessary gemological and appraisal training, has a minimum five (5) years experience, and has passed a closed book four (4) hour examination on appraisal theory, ethics and methodology in addition to a five (5) hour practical examination. Character references and other pertinent information is also required.

### **How long have you been appraising jewelry?**

Debòrah Ann Villepigue, one of the Industry’s foremost and credible jewelry appraisers, has been professionally crafting her art since 1987. Her business, “The Jewelry Appraiser, Inc.,” of Manhasset, NY, offers a plethora of comprehensive appraisal and consultation services.

### **Do you buy or sell jewelry?**

No. By not buying or selling, you receive a totally unbiased opinion of value. If you request selling information at the time of the appraisal, we will assist you and refer you to a potential buyer or other avenue(s) for liquidation.

### **May I wait and watch my items being appraised?**

Items may also be dropped off, mailed or in the convenience of your own residence, office or banking facility.

### **I need an update on my appraisal(s) for my insurance policy, do you do this?**

Yes. If the appraisals are from The Jewelry Appraiser, I will re-inspect your items, noting any changes that may have occurred, such as mounting alterations or damage, and update any new and pertinent information. The fee is by the hour. Normally, less time is required due to the fact most information is already in our system. If your appraisal(s) were done by another company or individual, it is company policy that all items be inspected and evaluated according to the standards used by The Jewelry Appraiser. It is found that many previous appraisals (one pagers in particular) by others lack important information, such as, description of gemstones/diamonds, description of mounting, gold marks, manufacturer marks, diamond plotting diagrams and PHOTOGRAPHS.

### **Do you appraise other items of personal property other than jewelry, watches and silver flatware?**

Items that are out of my expertise will not be appraised by myself. I will consult other appraisers who have knowledge and expertise in those types of personal property. No appraiser should claim to be an expert in everything.

### **A family member has passed away and I need an appraisal for estate tax purposes, do you do this?**

Yes, we perform numerous types of appraisals. They type of appraisal you need is determined by your intended use. Each appraisal states an intended use with its purpose and function. An estate appraisal is different than an insurance appraisal.

### **What questions should I ask before hiring a jewelry appraiser?**

Before you take your jewelry to a Jeweler, ask the following questions first:

* Are you a Graduate Gemologist of the GIA or the Gemological Association of Great Britain?
* When did you graduate?
* How long have you been in the jewelry industry? (Should have at least ten years of experience in the field).
* Are you also certified as an appraiser by an appraisal organization like the American Society of Appraisers or the Nation Association of Jewelry Appraisers. (There’s no such thing as a “GIA Certified Appraiser. There’s also no such thing as a “licensed appraiser” for personal property.)
* How long have you been in practice?
* Are your appraisals hand written or computer generated?
* Do you provide color photos of items?
* Have you had your color vision tested by an eye doctor recently?

Gemology and appraising are not the same thing! Gemologists are not necessarily qualified appraisers, and require significant training, certification, and experience to achieve competency in jewelry appraising. A gemologist may be able to identify and even grade a diamond, but may not know how to determine its value.

The bottom line: If you want to buy a piece of jewelry, see a jeweler. If you need a professional appraisal, hire an independent jewelry appraiser.

### **Why do I need an appraisal?**

The outcome of a professional jewelry appraisal is to describe your jewelry in enough detail to enable the full replacement of your jewelry in case of its loss. Typically, it includes a 20-point inspection.

Whether you are buying a new piece of jewelry, selling part of your collection, or you received a gift or inheritance of jewelry, determining exactly what you hold in your hand, and its actual worth, is very important. A professional jewelry appraisal, conducted by an accredited gemologist who is also certified as a gems and jewelry appraiser, provides the information you need.

An Appraisal Report is a package of information that includes:

* Who performed the appraisal of your jewelry
* When the appraisal took place
* The qualifications and accreditations of the appraisers
* The purpose or intent of the appraisal
* What was done during the appraisal
* Which standards were observed
* Which criteria went into the evaluation
* How the actual value of the jewelry determined
* The final value of the jewelry as of the date of the appraisal
* A Professional Jewelry Appraisal is your authoritative passport to peace of mind!
